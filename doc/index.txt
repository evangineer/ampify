Ampify
======

Ampify is a vision of an open and decentralised social platform. For comparison,
perhaps imagine a bastardised mix between Git, Facebook, Unix, IRC, App Engine,
Xanadu and Wikis.

The goal for the final 1.0 release is to have a fully decentralised "internet
operating system" style platform. We're currently working towards an initial
release, ``Ampify Zero``, for the end of this year -- `see the planfile
<planfile.html>`_ for more info.


Get Started With Ampify Development
-----------------------------------

You need to have `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_, a Unix-like OS, a bash shell, a
recent Python 2.x and general dev tools (gcc, make, etc.) installed.

.. syntax:: bash

  $ git clone https://github.com/espians/ampify.git # (1)
  $ cd ampify
  $ make                                            # (2)
  $ source environ/ampenv.sh                        # (3)
  $ amp init kickass                                # (4)
  $ amp run kickass                                 # (5)
  $ open https://localhost:9040                     # (6)

1. Clone the repository. You need to have Git 1.7+ in order to use the smart
   HTTP protocol.

2. Running ``make`` updates the submodules, builds various dependencies like
   Keyspace and Node.js, compiles CoffeeScript/Sass files and minifies the
   resulting JavaScript/CSS files. All builds are self-contained within the
   ``environ/local`` sub-directory that will be automatically created.

   You can run ``make clean`` to remove everything except the built
   dependencies, which you can also remove using the full ``make distclean``. Be
   sure to re-run ``make`` after you do a git pull or update -- this will keep
   the generated files up-to-date.

   Please note that running ``make`` for the first time currently takes around
   20 minutes, so you might want to grab something to drink and do something
   else like read `HN <http://news.ycombinator.com/>`_ or `xkcd
   <http://xkcd.com/>`_ -- with an eye on your terminal for any errors that
   might occur.

3. The ``ampenv.sh`` script adds command line auto-completion support on bash
   shells and extends a number of environment variables like ``$PATH``. As a
   result, a number of new commands will now be available to you -- including
   the core ``amp`` command.

   You might want to add this line to your ``~/.bashrc`` file or equivalent. So
   if you'd cloned the repository into ``/home/tav/ampify``, then you would add
   the following line to your ``~/.bashrc`` file:

   .. syntax:: bash

     source /home/tav/ampify/environ/ampenv.sh

4. You should read the `Running Ampify Zero <running-ampify-zero.html>`_
   document for these last steps. As it states, Ampify Zero doesn't work yet,
   but it goes into detail of how an instance is meant to be setup and run.

   You first initialise an instance using the ``amp`` utility script. This asks
   you a few questions and generates the appropriate files in a sibling
   directory to your Ampify repository. So, if you wanted to create an instance
   called ``kickass``, you'd:

   .. syntax:: bash

     $ amp init kickass

   Then, you'd run the various component processes of Ampify Zero with:

   .. syntax:: bash

     $ amp run kickass

   Do read the `Running Ampify Zero <running-ampify-zero.html>`_ doc for more
   info.

* Sign up to GitHub if you don't have an `account
  <https://github.com/signup/free>`_ — it takes just a minute! You can then
  `fork <http://help.github.com/forking/>`_ the `ampify repository
  <http://github.com/espians/ampify>`_ and send `pull requests
  <http://github.com/guides/pull-requests>`_ with any changes you might have.

.. syntax:: bash

  $ git clone git@github.com:yourUsername/ampify.git
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/espians/ampify.git

* Read the `getting started with git
  <http://www.espians.com/getting-started-with-git.html>`_ guide for Ampify
  Developers if you're new to git.

* Familiarise yourself with the Ampify testing and review process.

.. syntax:: bash

  # commit your changes to your local repository.
  $ git commit

  # submit an issue to be reviewed on
  # http://codereview.appspot.com — running this also
  # checks with appropriate local revhooks before your
  # submission is made.
  $ git review submit 

  # make any changes and keep committing and submitting
  # updates on the issue until the reviewers give a
  # LGTM (Looks Good To Me) reply.

  # once you have an okay, squash your various commits
  # into a single commit and push to the remote
  # repository.
  $ git review push

* Have fun!
