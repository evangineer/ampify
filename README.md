This is the repo for Ampify — an open and decentralised application platform.  
For comparison, perhaps imagine a bastardised mix between Git, Facebook,  
Unix, IRC, App Engine, [Xanadu] and Wikis.

The goal for the final 1.0 release is to have a fully decentralised "internet  
operating system" style platform. We're currently working towards an initial  
release, `Ampify Zero`, for the end of this year — [see the planfile].
